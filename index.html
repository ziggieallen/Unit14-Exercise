<!-- Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP?
HTTP governs how clients get data from, or get data to, a server.
What is a URL?
A Uniform Resource Locator is an address for an internet resource.
What is DNS?
Domain Name System is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them
into IP addresses.
What is a query string?
The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL.
What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET: get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)
POST: send some data to the server (posting something on social media, 
"changes data on server")
What is an HTTP request?
A resquest from a client to a server which follows the HTTP Protocol 
(a request for HTML from news.google.com)
What is an HTTP response?
A response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP Protocol 
(sending back HTML, CSS, JS, etc)
What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and 
response headers you have seen.
Headers provide additional information about the request or the response
EX. date, cache-control, vary, strict
What are the processes that happen when you type 
“http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? -->
<!-- 1. Your browser 'resolves' the name in an IP address using DNS
2. Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info
about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
3. The server sends a response (typically HTML, with a status code)
4. The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed 
(images, CSS, JS, etc)
5. The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives responses
from the server for each.  -->
